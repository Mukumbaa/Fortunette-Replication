## How to View HTML Pages

To properly open the HTML pages, you need to start a local Python server.

### Instructions

1. Open the terminal in the project's root folder.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8000/FILE-NAME.html
   ```

Replace `FILE-NAME.html` with the name of the HTML file you want to view.
